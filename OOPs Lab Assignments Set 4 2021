//Assignment 4: Implementing Useful Data Structures Classes in C+

Objectives:

 

● Learn to implement composition

 

·         Learn to define and use your own header file

 

·         Use the concepts copy constructor, define constructors using default arguments, etc.

 

 

// A1.  Write a hashing class which uses the linked list class header file to implement open hashing using Channing. Use modular hash function (x%10).  Generate 100 random int key values and insert each of them and perform searching. Report the % of load in each of 10 buckets. Try any other different hash function and report which one is better. Implement the following methods

-          Search

-          Insert

-          Delete

-          Display

-          TableLoadDistr

 

// A2. Write a polynomial class to store and evaluate display and add polynomials. Make use of the node class to implement a polynomial as a chain of linked nodes. Maintain the nodes in increasing order of exponents. Consider both exponent & coefficients to be interger. Include suitable methods like:

-          InsertTerm

-          DeleteTerm

-          DisplayPoly

-          EvalPoly

-          AddPoly
