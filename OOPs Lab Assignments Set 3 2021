Assignment 3: C++ Struct/Class

Objectives:

 

● Writing basic class definition and creation of objects, passing objects, dynamic allocation of objects

·         Use of constructors, destructor

 Use suitable overloaded constructors in each class definitions; show in main the creation of single object static and dynamic allocation and also an array of objects both static and dynamic (as shown in the class Lecture) 

 

// 1. Implement a stack class. You should have atleast these member functions:  initialize (construct),

deconstruct, push, pop, display, isempty, isfull, etc. Show the use of the class by creating objects and calling the member functions.

 

// 2. Implement a queue class. You should have atleast these member functions:  initialize (construct),

deconstruct, push, pop, display, isempty, isfull, etc. Show the use of the class by creating objects and calling the member functions.

 

// 3 Implement a matrix class. You should have atleast these member functions:  allocatespace, readmatrix, displayMatrix, addMartix, multMatrix, detMatrix. Write another function CramerRule which accept matrices A and C and outputs the solution of a set of linear equations (AX=C).

 

// 4. Implement a linear linked list class which performs insertion (at begining) and deletion as given

the key. You should have atleast these member functions: 

initialize (construct),

deconstruct,

display,

insetBeg,

delete,

concatenate,

search.

Show the use of the class by creating objects and calling the member functions. Use your own random number to generate values to insert and delete.
